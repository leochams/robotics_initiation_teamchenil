In this directory you will find our simulation codes to interact in simulation on our hexapod.
We have coded our hexapod so that it can notably walk in a holonomic way, that is to say, be able to walk in all directions.

1st : clone our repository 
2nd: open with visual code
3rd: run IG.py and click on the chosen mode to launch the simulation
